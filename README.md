# Type-master
This is another python GUI application, named Type Master.
Here we can practice typing any number of times and can get our score everytime.
Around 271 words are picked at random, we need to type each word that is displayed on the screen.
To start the game we need to click "Enter", then words will start to appear and the time duration is 1min.
Each time we enter the correct word the score will be increased by 1 point and there are no negative points for those words that are incorrectly typed.
And to start a new game just click on the "new game" button.
This 'new game' button is disabled while the game is already running, it is enabled only after the present game is completed.
